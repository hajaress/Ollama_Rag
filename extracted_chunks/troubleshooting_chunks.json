HYDROGEN\nGAS IS EXPLOSIVE. If your hot water system has not been used for two weeks or\nmore, turn on all hot water faucets in your home, and let the water flow for several\nminutes before using your washer. This will release any hydrogen gas build–up. Since\nhydrogen gas is flammable, do not smoke or light an open flame during this time.\nVentilate the room immediately without touching the power plug if there is a gas leak.\nUnplug the power cord before servicing your washer.\nDo not reach into the appliance when the tub is moving.\nDo not reach under the appliance with your hands or with an object as you may be injured\nby the spinning parts beneath the washer.\nDo not let children play on or in your washer.

The drain hose must be routed\nthrough the drain hose clip to the standpipe. The standpipe must be large enough to accept the\noutside diameter of the drain hose. The drain hose is attached to the washer at the factory.\nFlooring\nFor best performance, you must install your washer on a solidly constructed floor. Wood floors\nmay need to be reinforced to minimize vibration and/or unbalanced load situations. Carpeting\nand soft tile surfaces are contributing factors to vibration which can cause your washer to move\nslightly during the spin cycle.\nNever install your washer on a platform or weakly supported structure.\nLocation considerations\nDo not install your washer in areas where water may freeze, since your washer will always retain\nsome water in its water valve, pump, and hose areas.
